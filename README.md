# GNDiscordBot

# TODO WRITE MORE INFO HERE

- Simple little bot that integrates different things into discord


TODO
- Move most string messages to the `strings.js` file
- Update commands to check for permissions (Check if there is a better way to do this rather than checking it while the command is running?)
- Use a different DB since Mongo DB doesn't work for my box
- Add the capability for the bot to use AI???
- ???
